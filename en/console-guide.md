## Database > EasyCache > Console User Guide

## Getting Started

To enable EasyCache, it is required to create a replication group first. 

## Replication Groups

### Create 

1. From **Replication Group** on **Console > Database > EasyCache**, click **Create** and a popup for **Create Replication Groups** shows.

![rep_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.08.07/rep_create_001.PNG)

2. Enter all requirements on the setting window and click **Create** at the bottom. 

    - Name of Replication Group: Enter name of a replication group. 
    - Description: Enter description of the group.
    - Service Port: Enter port number of Redis. 
      - Setting is available between 10000 and 12000.  
    - Version: Select a Redis version to create. 
      - As of June 2020, only 5.0.8 is supported.
    - Instance Type: Select specifications for the replication group. 
    - Max Memory:  Adjust the max memory to prevent memory shortage from synchronization or backup.
      - You may change the volume of max memory for a Redis server. 
      - If required, memory volume can be flexibly secured for management. 
    - Availability Area:  Select an area to create a replication group. 
    - Configuration Profile: Select a configuration file for Redis.
      - Provides default profile. 
      - More configuration profiles can be added for selection.
    - VPC Subnet: Select a subnet for Compute &  Network to allow private network communication; if not, a default network shall be configured. 
    - Auto Backup Setting: Select whether to enable auto backup. 
      - Backup Retention Period: Available from 1 day up to 30 days.
      - Backup Start Time: Specify start time of backup, by 30-minute interval. 
      - Backup Time: Backup starts randomly between start time and specified time. Available from 1 hour up to 3 hours. 
3. Click **Create**. 

4. Check inputs on the screen and click **Create**. 
   Along with a replication group, a master node is created. It takes a few minutes to create. 
##### Constraints
- Service is restricted for such commands that may severely impact service. 
- See developer's guide to find out the commands. 

### Replicate (Add Nodes)

By creating a replica node supported by Redis, availability can be raised. 

1. To create a replica node, select an original replication group and click **Add Nodes**. 

![nod_ad_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_node_add_002.PNG)

2. To see if the master node has gone down, set wait time for health check response. Default is 3000ms.  

3. Select an availability area to create a replica node. By selecting a different availability area from the original master node, the availability goes higher. 

4. Find out information of the master node. 

5. Click **Add**, and a replica node is created. 
6. To check information of the node, go to **Replication Groups > Node Information**. 
   Replication relation is automatically set while it is created. 

The replica node has the same server specifications as the original master node. 
It may take more time to create a replica node, in proportion to the size of the original master node. 

##### Constraints 

- An original master node can create only one replica node. 
- A replica node cannot create its own replica nodes under it. 

#### High Availability (HA)

By adding a replica node to the standalone master node, high availability is automatically configured. 

- By setting an auto failover, downtime can be reduced to the minimum when an error occurs on the master node. 
- Failover refers to detecting a master node in which error has occurred and thereby automatically promoting a replica node to the master. 
- You may find events on failure and status of the master or replica node. 

##### Constraints

- If it fails to set up high availability while adding a replica node, go to **Replication Groups > Basic Information** and click **Reconfigure HA** so as to re-configure high availability. 

![rep_ha_error_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_ha_error_001.PNG)

- With a failover, the existing master node in which error occurred is suspended. When the failed node is deleted, it is changed into a general standalone master node in which high availability is not enabled. 
- By adding a replica node to the standalone master node, high availability can be newly specified. 
- The newly changed master node inherits the domain applied to access the existing master node. 
- The existing node with failover becomes 'Disabled', under which, high availability is not enabled only with the new master node.  

### Modify 

1. Select an original replication group, and click **Modify**. 
2. On the popup of **Modify Replication Group**, set name and backup period.  

![rep_mo_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_modify_002.PNG)

- Name of Replication Group: Name of a replication group can be changed. 
- Description: Description of a replication group can be changed. 
- Configuration Profile: Redis setting can be changed. 
- Max Memory: Volume of the maximum memory for usage can be changed. 
- Master Down Time: Wait time can be configured for a health check response to see if the master node is down; default is 3000ms. 
- Auto Backup Setting: Select whether to use auto backup. 
	- Backup Retention Period: From 1 day, up to 30 days
	- Backup Start Time: Specify start time of a backup, by 30-minute interval.
	- Backup Time: Backup to start randomly between start time and a specific time, from 1 hour up to 3 hours. 

3. Check changes and click **Change**. 
    Service port, Redis Version, Instance Type, and Availability Area cannot be changed, once they're configured. 
### Auto Backups

- Memory data (RDB file) is automatically backed up at a specific time once every day. 
- To manage auto backups that are created, go to **Backup**. 
- When a replication group bound for backup is deleted, bacup files are deleted altogether. 
- After a backup retention period, backup files will be automatically deleted. 
- Auto backup is to start randomly between start time and backup time. 

### Create Manual Backups 

You may create a backup for replication group at a time of choice. Even if a replication group bound for backup is deleted, manual backup files cannot be deleted. 

- Manage created manual backups from the **Backup** tab. 
- Performance may be degraded while backup is executed. 
- After a backup retention period, backup files will be automatically deleted. 
- If a replication group bound for backup is deleted, details of the group are not displayed for basic information. 

1. To create manual backup files, select a replication group and click **Manual Backup**. 
2. Enter information for **Manual Backup** and click **Backup**. It may take more time to create a backup in proportion to the size of data. 
    ![manual_backup_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_manual_backup_001.PNG)

- Backup Name: Enter name of a backup. 
- Description: Enter description of a backup. 
- Backup Retention Period: You may not delete, or retain backup from 1 day, up to 30 days. 

### Accredited domain setup

* Only instances that use the same subnet can log in to duplicate group. However, if you want to allow external login, you may set up the accredited domain.
![manual_backup_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_public_domain_001.png)

### Read-only domain setup

* After selecting target duplicate group where a Replica node is added to, click other action button (â‹¯) and click **Read-only domain setup** to set up a read-only domain.
* The read-only domain you set is a private domain that can be logged in from the VPC subnet you selected when creating a duplicate group, and this is where the IP of the Replica node is bound to.
* Go to **duplicate group > login information** if you want to check the read-only domain you set.
* If failover occurs due to the fault of the Master node
  * Until the old Master node is recovered with the Replica node or a new Replica node is added after deleting the old one, read-only domain maintains the state of having the IP of the old Replica node that has been promoted to the Master node due to the failover.
  * If the old Master node is recovered with the Replica node or a new Replica node is added after deleting the old one, the binding of the read-only domain changes to the IP of the new Replica node.
    * If binding fails, you can manually retry in **duplicate group > login information**.
* When the Replica node fails
  * The binding of the read-only domain changes to the IP of the Master node.
  * If the Replica node is recovered or a new Replica node is added after deleting the old one, the binding of the read-only domain changes to the IP of the new  Replica node.
    * If binding fails, you can manually retry in **duplicate group > login information**.
* While read-only domain is set up, you can delete the Replica node or duplicate group, or disable the service.
  * While read-only domain is set up, if the Replica node is deleted, the binding of the read-only domain changes to the IP of the Master node.
  * While read-only domain is set up, if duplicate group is deleted or its service is disable, the read-only domain is unbound.

##### Constraints

* When the binding of the read-only domain is changed
  * When binding is changed without login interruption (for instance, when new Replica node is added after failover of the Master node)
    * If the client logged in as a read-only domain supports the detection of binding change in domains or such logic is implemented, user is logged in again using the changed binding IP. Otherwise, user has to terminate the current login and log in again.
  * When binding change results in disconnection (e.g. when Replica node fails or is deleted)
    * If the client supports automatic relogin or such logic is implemented, user is logged in with the changed binding IP. Otherwise, user has to log in again.
    
### Change Instance Types 

* It is available to change the instance type of a node in service.  
* Change of an instance type means upgrading to higher specifications only. 
* While a type change is underway, node is suspended  from service.  
* With the change of instance type, data is reverted to a time of backup, and if backup was not available, data goes back to default.   
* When there's a replica node, failover occurs to change instance type of the master node.  

![instance_type_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_instance_type_001.png)

##### Constraints 

- Redundant manual backup is unavailable. Try again after current manual backup is done. 
- Executing a manual backup during auto backup time may cause delays in the backup.

- Following items can be found: 
  - Name, type, IP, availability area, date of creation, and status of node 

## Monitoring 

EasyCache collects monitoring items that are required to run and use Redis at every minute and shows such data on a chart. 

![monitoring_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.05.14/monitoring_001.PNG)

- With every click of the 1-hour or 24-hour button, it is updated as of the current time. 
  - **1 Hour** shows data collected at every minute on a chart. 
  - **12 Hours** shows 10-minute average of collected data on a chart. 
  - **24 Hours** shows 10-minute average of collected data on a chart. 
  - **1 Month** shows 6-hour average of collected data on a chart. 
  - Click **Specify** to specify a search period. 
- Search period can be specified with clicks on the calendar.  
  - Although a day or time is selected on the calendar, selected search period sustains. 
- A click on the current time results in the re-search of a selected period as of the current time. 
- With an arrow on the right of the current time button, you may search for time before or after, as much as the search period. 
- A replication group can be selected to show charts from the replication group dropdown. 
- With Auto Update enabled, chart data can be updated at every 60 seconds. 
- By clicking on the chart, it is expanded for display. 
- On an expanded chart, statistics and collection period may be changed for display. 
  - Statistical method is applied to show accumulated data, and if the collection time is 1 minute, same value will be displayed even with changed statistics, since low data is applied. 
- Monitoring data can be retained for 1 month. 

![monitoring_002.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.05.14/monitoring_002.PNG)

## Alarms 

EasyCache sends alarms on a particular event occurred from a resource of choice to a recipient group. 

![eve_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.04.28/alarm_001.PNG)

### Alarm Rules 

Specify the condition, target, and recipient group for an alarm. 
1. To set alarms you need, go to **Notification** and click **Create Alarm Rules**. 

2. On the popup for **Create Alarm Rules**, specify the condition of sending an alarm and recipient groups. 
![eve_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.04.28/alarm_002.PNG)

3. There are two alarm conditions: **Metric Condition** and **Event Condition**. 

- **Metric Condition**: Alarm conditions are specified by using performance indicators (see monitoring items) that are collected from cache instances, like follows: 
  - Metric name, operator, type of collection, frequency of evaluation, and threshold value 
- **Event Condition**: Specify events to be alerted (see event items) out of all events occurred within service. 

4. Click **View Recipient Groups** to check recipient groups or add more. 

5. Alarm rules are basically applied to all replication groups. To create an alarm rule only for a specific replication group, specify the replication group for **Target Replication Groups**. 

6. After setting is done, click **Create**. 

Alarm rules, after created, can be disabled and temporarily turned off. 

### Recipient Groups 

Alarm recipients can be managed under each group. 

![not_re_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.04.28/alarm_004.PNG)

- To check recipient groups, click **View Recipient Groups**. 
- If you don't have a group in need, click **Create Recipient Groups** to create a new group. 
- Available recipients to be specified by each group are confined to project members only. 
  - Messages can be mailed or texted to the email address or phone number registered for TOAST membership. 
- Note that, by deleting a current recipient group for alarm rules, no more alarms are to be sent, if there's no other recipient group. 

##### Constraints 

- If there's only one replication group as the target of alarm rules, and if the group has been deleted from the replication group page, further alarms are to be sent to all replication groups because its only replication group is gone. 
- If there's only one recipient group for alarm rules, and if the group has been deleted from the detail recipient group page, no further alarms can be sent because its only recipient group is gone. 
- Alarms for the creation of a replication group are sent for all replication groups, even if there's a target replication group. 
- If a new user is added to a project, about an hour of wait time may be incurred until the user is synchronized to the list of project users of a recipient group. 

## Events

1. Select **Event**. 

2. EasyCache automatically retains significant events occurred at a replication group. 

3. Enter a word to search on the search window and click **Search**, and search results shows on the resource name and description of an event. 

![eve_002.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.04.28/event_001.PNG)

- Search by time or date is available. 
- Event data can be retained for a month. 
- Event type refers to a resource type from which an event has occurred. 
  - ALL: Events related to NODE and REPLICATION_GROUP. 
  - NODE: Events related to NODE. 
  - REPLICATION_GROUP: Events related to REPLICATION_GROUP. 
  - PROFILE: Events related to PROFILE.
